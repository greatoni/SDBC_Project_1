    My name is Elijah Wakeling, I'm a graduate Game Designer from Champlain College.
    I have a preference towards strategy games, RPGs, and other games more geared towards thinking rather than action. 
    I have mainly worked on various projects throughout my career as a game designer.</p> <br>
